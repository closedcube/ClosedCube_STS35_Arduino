- Typical accuracy of up to +/- 0.1 Â°C
- Fully calibrated and linearized digital output
- Wide supply voltage range, from 2.15 V to 5.5 V
- Very fast start-up and measurement time
- I2C address either 0x4A or 0x4B

^ - with DIP switch

**Requirements:**

- ClosedCube I2C Driver (Wrapper) https://github.com/closedcube/ClosedCube_I2C_Arduino
